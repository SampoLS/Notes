          principle that states that every module, class or function in a
          computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that
          program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of
          that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned
          with that responsibility.

          "Don't repeat yourself" (DRY, or sometimes "do not repeat yourself")
          is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of
          software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data
          normalization to avoid redundancy. The DRY principle is stated as
          "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous,
          authoritative representation within a system". When the DRY principle
          is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a
          system does not require a change in other logically unrelated
          elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change
          predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync.

          In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique
          used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of
          expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same
          inputs occur again. Memoization has also been used in other contexts
          (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple mutually
          recursive descent parsing. Although related to caching, memoization
          refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from
          forms of caching such as buffering or page replacement. In the context
          of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as
          tabling.

          Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on
          the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the
          form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in
          the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects
          is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the
          data fields of itself (objects have a notion of this or self). In OOP,
          computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that
          interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most
          popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of
          classes, which also determine their types.

          are referenced by identifiers. In the object-oriented programming

          paradigm it refers to a particular instance of a class. In the

          In computing, serialization (US spelling) or serialisation (UK

          state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or
          memory data buffer) or transmitted (for example, over a computer
          network) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer
          environment). When the resulting series of bits is reread according to
          the serialization format, it can be used to create a semantically
          identical clone of the original object. For many complex objects, such
          as those that make extensive use of references, this process is not
          straightforward. Serialization of object-oriented objects does not

          In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a
          variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each
          instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An
          instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is
          non-static. An instance variable is a variable which is declared in a
          class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks. Instance
          variables are created when an object is instantiated, and are
          accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class.
          Access modifiers can be given to the instance variable.

          A programming language consists of a grammar/syntax plus an execution

          of a program that was written in terms of that programming language.

          through what each line of code does. In effect they simulate the
          behavior inside their mind. What the programmer is doing is applying
          the execution model to the code, which results in the behavior of the

          In computing, data (treated as singular, plural, or as a mass noun) is
          any sequence of one or more symbols; datum is a single symbol of data.
          Data requires interpretation to become information. Digital data is
          data that is represented using the binary number system of ones (1)
          and zeros (0), instead of analog representation. In modern (post-1960)
          computer systems, all data is digital.

          Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving
          the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by
          making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of
          selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block
          structures, and subroutines.

          In computer science, predication is an architectural feature that
          provides an alternative to conditional transfer of control, as
          implemented by conditional branch machine instructions. Predication
          works by having conditional (predicated) non-branch instructions
          associated with a predicate, a Boolean value used by the instruction
          to control whether the instruction is allowed to modify the
          architectural state or not. If the predicate specified in the
          instruction is true, the instruction modifies the architectural state;
          otherwise, the architectural state is unchanged. For example, a
          predicated move instruction (a conditional move) will only modify the
          destination if the predicate is true. Thus, instead of using a
          conditional branch to select an instruction or a sequence of
          instructions to execute based on the predicate that controls whether
          the branch occurs, the instructions to be executed are associated with
          that predicate, so that they will be executed, or not executed, based
          on whether that predicate is true or false.

          In computer programming, an automatic variable is a local variable
          which is allocated and deallocated automatically when program flow
          enters and leaves the variable's scope. The scope is the lexical
          context, particularly the function or block in which a variable is
          defined. Local data is typically (in most languages) invisible outside
          the function or lexical context where it is defined. Local data is
          also invisible and inaccessible to a called function, but is not
          deallocated, coming back in scope as the execution thread returns to
          the caller.

          The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital

          The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists
          of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to
          encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it
          is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer
          architectures. To disambiguate arbitrarily sized bytes from the common
          8-bit definition, network protocol documents such as The Internet
          Protocol (RFC 791) refer to an 8-bit byte as an octet. Those bits in
          an octet are usually counted with numbering from 0 to 7 or 7 to 0
          depending on the bit endianness. The first bit is number 0, making the
          eighth bit number 7.
