          principle that states that every module, class or function in a
          computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that
          program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of
          that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned
          with that responsibility.

          "Don't repeat yourself" (DRY, or sometimes "do not repeat yourself")
          is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of
          software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data
          normalization to avoid redundancy. The DRY principle is stated as
          "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous,
          authoritative representation within a system". When the DRY principle
          is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a
          system does not require a change in other logically unrelated
          elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change
          predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync.

          In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique
          used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of
          expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same
          inputs occur again. Memoization has also been used in other contexts
          (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple mutually
          recursive descent parsing. Although related to caching, memoization
          refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from
          forms of caching such as buffering or page replacement. In the context
          of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as
          tabling.

          Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on
          the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the
          form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in
          the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects
          is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the
          data fields of itself (objects have a notion of this or self). In OOP,
          computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that
          interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most
          popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of
          classes, which also determine their types.

          are referenced by identifiers. In the object-oriented programming
          paradigm, object can be a combination of variables, functions, and
          data structures; in particular in class-based variations of the
          paradigm it refers to a particular instance of a class. In the
          relational model of database management, an object can be a table or

          returning a value (the intended effect) to the invoker of the
