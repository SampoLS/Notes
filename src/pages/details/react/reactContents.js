          A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with
          markup(html-like tag in React component called JSX). React lets you
          combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components,”
          reusable UI elements for your app: their names always begin with a
          capital letter, they return JSX markup. Just like with HTML tags, you
          can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. You can
          define a component once, and then use it in as many places and as many
          times as you like. In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.

        <p>
          JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like
          markup inside a JavaScript file. React components use a syntax
          extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like
          HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information. As
          the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined
          content. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML! This is why in React,
          rendering logic and markup live together in the same place—components!
          Keeping a component's(such as button) rendering logic and markup
          together ensures that they stay in sync with each other on every edit.
          JSX is very minimal as a templating language because it lets you
          organize data and logic using JavaScript.

          <p>
            JSX is a special way of writing JavaScript. That means it's possible
            to use JavaScript inside it—with curly braces {"{}"}. Any JavaScript
            expression will work between curly braces, including function calls.
            You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX: 1. As text
            directly inside a JSX tag. 2. As attributes immediately following
            the = sign.

            Using “double curlies”: CSS and other objects in JSX. In addition to
            strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even
            pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces,
            like {'{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }'}. Therefore, to pass
            a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of
            curly braces: person=
            {'{{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }}'}. The next time you see{" "}
            {"{{ and }}"} in JSX, know that it's nothing more than an object
            inside the JSX curlies!

          React components use props to communicate with each other. Every

          giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you
          can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays,
          and functions. React component functions accept a single argument, a
          'props' object. You can't change props. When you need interactivity,
          you'll need to set state.

          Some JavaScript functions are “pure.” Pure functions only perform a
          calculation and nothing more. By strictly only writing your components
          as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and
          unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows. A function is said to
          be pure if the return value is determined by its input values only and
          the return value is always the same for the same input values. A React
          component is said to be pure if it renders the same output for the
          same state and props. React's rendering process must always be pure.
          Components should only return their JSX, and not change any objects or
          variables that existed before rendering—that would make them impure!

          React lets you add event handlers to your JSX. To add an event
          handler, you will first define a function and then pass it as a prop
          to the appropriate JSX tag. Event handlers are the best place for side

          Setting state only changes it for the next render. A state variable's
          value never changes within a render, even if its event handler's code
          is asynchronous. React keeps the state values “fixed” within one
          render's event handlers. You don't need to worry whether the state has
          changed while the code is running. Variables and event handlers don't
          “survive” re-renders. Every render has its own event handlers. React
          waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing
          your state updates. Setting state does not change the variable in the
          existing render, but it requests a new render. React processes state
          updates after event handlers have finished running. This is called
          batching.

          State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But
          you shouldn't change objects that you hold in the React state

          create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the

          rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result.
          React.memo only checks for prop changes. If your function component
          wrapped in React.memo has a useState, useReducer or useContext Hook in
          its implementation, it will still rerender when state or context

          The callback function will be re-created as the component re-rendered

          used to optimize the rendering behavior of your React function
          components. Returns a memoized callback. Pass an inline callback and
          an array of dependencies. useCallback will return a memoized version
          of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has
          changed. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child
          components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary
          renders (e.g. shouldComponentUpdate). useCallback function is used to
          wrap a function to mitigate the re-render when other function does

            When you want a component to “remember” some information, but you

            The ref points to a number, but, like state, you could point to

            is a plain JavaScript object with the current property that you can
