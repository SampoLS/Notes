          English is a West Germanic language of the Indo-European language
          family, with its earliest forms spoken by the inhabitants of early
          medieval England. It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient
          Germanic peoples that migrated to the island of Great Britain. English
          is genealogically West Germanic, closest related to the Low Saxon and
          Frisian languages; however, its vocabulary is also distinctively
          influenced by dialects of French (about 29% of modern English words)
          and Latin (also about 29%), plus some grammar and a small amount of
          core vocabulary influenced by Old Norse (a North Germanic language).
          Speakers of English are called Anglophones.

        <p>This article describes the syntax of clauses in the English language, chiefly in Modern English. A clause is often said to be the smallest grammatical unit that can express a complete proposition. But this semantic idea of a clause leaves out much of English clause syntax. For example, clauses can be questions, but questions are not propositions. A syntactic description of an English clause is that it is a subject and a verb. But this too fails, as a clause need not have a subject, as with the imperative, and, in many theories, an English clause may be verbless. The idea of what qualifies varies between theories and has changed over time.</p>

In English, a given word may have several senses, and be either a preposition or a conjunction depending on the syntax of the sentence.

The main trait of all predicative expressions is that they serve to express a property that is assigned to a "subject", whereby this subject is usually the clause subject, but at times it can be the clause object. A primary distinction is drawn between predicative (also predicate) and attributive expressions. Further, predicative expressions are typically not clause arguments, and they are also typically not clause adjuncts.

        <p>An adjective phrase (or adjectival phrase) is a phrase whose head is an adjective. Almost any grammar or syntax textbook or dictionary of linguistics terminology defines the adjective phrase in a similar way, e.g. Kesner Bland (1996:499), Crystal (1996:9), Greenbaum (1996:288ff.), Haegeman and Guéron (1999:70f.), Brinton (2000:172f.), Jurafsky and Martin (2000:362). The adjective can initiate the phrase (e.g. fond of steak), conclude the phrase (e.g. very happy), or appear in a medial position (e.g. quite upset about it). The dependents of the head adjective—i.e. the other words and phrases inside the adjective phrase—are typically adverb or prepositional phrases, but they can also be clauses (e.g. louder than you are). Adjectives and adjective phrases function in two basic ways, attributively or predicatively. An attributive adjective (phrase) precedes the noun of a noun phrase (e.g. a very happy man). A predicative adjective (phrase) follows a linking verb and serves to describe the preceding subject, e.g. The man is very happy.</p>

An example is the verb have in the sentence I have finished my lunch. Here, the auxiliary have helps to express the perfect aspect along with the participle, finished. Some sentences contain a chain of two or more auxiliary verbs. Auxiliary verbs are also called helping verbs, helper verbs, or (verbal) auxiliaries.

          "the very happy squirrel" is a noun phrase which contains the
          adjective phrase "very happy". Phrases can consist of a single word or
          a complete sentence. In theoretical linguistics, phrases are often
          analyzed as units of syntactic structure such as a constituent.

          In language, a clause is a constituent that comprises a semantic
          predicand (expressed or not) and a semantic predicate. A typical
          clause consists of a subject and a syntactic predicate, the latter
          typically a verb phrase composed of a verb with any objects and other
          modifiers. However, the subject is sometimes unvoiced if it is
          retrievable from context, especially in null-subject language but also
          in other languages, including English instances of the imperative
          mood.

          English nouns form the largest category of words in English, both in
          terms of the number of different words and in terms of how often they
          are used in typical texts. The three main categories of English nouns
          are common nouns, proper nouns, and pronouns. A defining feature of
          English nouns is their ability to inflect for number, as through the
          plural -s morpheme. English nouns primarily function as the heads of
          noun phrases, which prototypically function at the clause level as
          subjects, objects, and predicative complements. These phrases are the
          only English phrases whose structure includes determinatives and
          predeterminatives, which add abstract specifying meaning such as
          definiteness and proximity. Like nouns in general, English nouns
          typically denote physical objects, but they also denote actions (e.g.,
          get up and have a stretch), characteristics (e.g., this red is
          lovely), relations in space (e.g., closeness), and just about anything
          at all. Taken all together, these features separate English nouns from
          the language's other lexical categories, such as adjectives and verbs.

          Verbs constitute one of the main parts of speech (word classes) in the
          English language. Like other types of words in the language, English
          verbs are not heavily inflected. Most combinations of tense, aspect,
          mood and voice are expressed periphrastically, using constructions
          with auxiliary verbs.

          The present tense (abbreviated PRES or PRS) is a grammatical tense
          whose principal function is to locate a situation or event in the
          present time. The present tense is used for actions which are
          happening now. In order to explain and understand present tense, it is
          useful to imagine time as a line on which the past tense, the present
          and the future tense are positioned. The term present tense is usually
          used in descriptions of specific languages to refer to a particular
          grammatical form or set of forms; these may have a variety of uses,
          not all of which will necessarily refer to present time. For example,
          in the English sentence "My train leaves tomorrow morning", the verb
          form leaves is said to be in the present tense, even though in this
          particular context it refers to an event in future time. Similarly, in
          the historical present, the present tense is used to narrate events
          that occurred in the past.

          are usually manifested by the use of specific forms of verbs,

          English adjectives form a large open category of words in English
          which, semantically, tend to denote properties such as size, colour,
          mood, quality, age, etc. with such members as other, big, new, good,
          different, Cuban, sure, important, and right. Adjectives head
          adjective phrases, and the most typical members function as modifiers
          in noun phrases. Most adjectives either inflect for grade (e.g., big,
          bigger, biggest) or combine with more and most to form comparatives
          (e.g., more interesting) and superlatives (e.g., most interesting).
          They are characteristically modifiable by very (e.g., very small). A
          large number of the most typical members combine with the suffix -ly
          to form adverbs (e.g., final + ly: finally). Most adjectives function
          as complements in verb phrases (e.g., It looks good), and some license
          complements of their own (e.g., happy that you're here).
