          The useParams hook returns an object of key/value pairs of the dynamic
          params from the current URL that were matched by the &lt;Route
          path&gt;. Child routes inherit all params from their parent routes.
          Use ':style' syntax in your route path and useParams() to read them. A
          very common use-case is fetching data when the component renders.

          Search params are like URL params but they sit in a different position
          in the URL. Instead of being in the normal URL segments separated by
          /, they are at the end after a ?. You've seen them across the web like
          "/login?success=1" or "/shoes?brand=nike&sort=asc&sortby=price".

          with useSearchParams. It works a lot like React.useState() but stores
          and sets the state in the URL search params instead of in memory.
