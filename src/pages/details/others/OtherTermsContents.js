          prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent
          information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they

          and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner
          accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.

          Motivation is the reason for which humans and other animals initiate,

          are commonly understood as forces acting within the agent that create
          a disposition to engage in goal-directed behavior. It is often held
          that different mental states compete with each other and that only the
          strongest state determines behavior. This means that we can be
          motivated to do something without actually doing it. The paradigmatic
          mental state providing motivation is desire. But various other states,
          such as beliefs about what one ought to do or intentions, may also
          provide motivation. Motivation is derived from the word 'motive,'
          which denotes a person's needs, desires, wants, or urges. It is the
          process of motivating individuals to take action in order to achieve a
          goal. The psychological elements fueling people's behavior in the
          context of job goals might include a desire for money.

          In the philosophy of mathematics, formalism is the view that holds

          statements about the consequences of the manipulation of strings
          (alphanumeric sequences of symbols, usually as equations) using
          established manipulation rules. A central idea of formalism "is that
          mathematics is not a body of propositions representing an abstract
          sector of reality, but is much more akin to a game, bringing with it
          no more commitment to an ontology of objects or properties than ludo
          or chess." According to formalism, the truths expressed in logic and
          mathematics are not about numbers, sets, or triangles or any other
          coextensive subject matter — in fact, they aren't "about" anything at
          all. Rather, mathematical statements are syntactic forms whose shapes
          and locations have no meaning unless they are given an interpretation
          (or semantics). In contrast to mathematical realism, logicism, or
          intuitionism, formalism's contours are less defined due to broad
          approaches that can be categorized as formalist.

          A method is a structured procedure for bringing about a certain goal.
          In the context of research, this goal is usually to discover new
          knowledge or to verify pre-existing knowledge claims. This normally
          involves various steps, like choosing a sample, collecting data from
          this sample, and interpreting this data. The study of methods involves
          a detailed description and analysis of these processes. It includes
          evaluative aspects by comparing different methods to assess their
          advantages and disadvantages relative to different research goals and
          situations. This way, a methodology can help make the research process
          efficient and reliable by guiding researchers on which method to
          employ at each step. These descriptions and evaluations of methods
          often depend on philosophical background assumptions. The assumptions
          are about issues like how the studied phenomena are to be
          conceptualized, what constitutes evidence for or against them, and
          what the general goal of research is. When understood in the widest

          Communication (from Latin: communicare, meaning "to share" or "to be
          in relation with") is "an apparent answer to the painful divisions
          between self and other, private and public, and inner thought and
          outer world." As this definition indicates, communication is difficult
          to define in a consistent manner, because in common use it refers to a
          very wide range of different behaviours involved in the propagation of
          information. John Peters argues the difficulty of defining
          communication emerges from the fact that communication is both a
          universal phenomenon (because everyone communicates) and a specific
          discipline of institutional academic study.

          items are presented. In this sense, seeing a yellow bird on a branch
          presents the subject with the objects "bird" and "branch", the
          relation between them and the property "yellow". Unreal items may be
          included as well, which happens when experiencing hallucinations or
          dreams. When understood in a more restricted sense, only sensory
          consciousness counts as experience. In this sense, experience is
          usually identified with perception and contrasted with other types of
          conscious events, like thinking or imagining. In a slightly different
          sense, experience refers not to the conscious events themselves but to
          the practical knowledge and familiarity they produce. In this sense,
          it is important that direct perceptual contact with the external world
          is the source of knowledge. So an experienced hiker is someone who
          actually lived through many hikes, not someone who merely read many
          books about hiking. This is associated both with recurrent past

          In philosophy, events are objects in time or instantiations of

          acquiring or losing a property can constitute events, like the lawn's
          becoming dry. According to others, there are also events that involve
          nothing but the retaining of a property, e.g. the lawn's staying wet.
          Events are usually defined as particulars that, unlike universals,
          cannot repeat at different times. Processes are complex events
          constituted by a sequence of events. But even simple events can be
          conceived as complex entities involving an object, a time and the
          property exemplified by the object at this time. Traditionally,
          metaphysicians tended to emphasize static being over dynamic events.
          This tendency has been opposed by so-called process philosophy or

          An action is an event that an agent performs for a purpose, that is
          guided by the person's intention. The first question in the philosophy
          of action is to determine how actions differ from other forms of
          behavior, like involuntary reflexes. According to Ludwig Wittgenstein,
          it involves discovering "[w]hat is left over if I subtract the fact
          that my arm goes up from the fact that I raise my arm". There is broad
          agreement that the answer to this question has to do with the agent's
          intentions. So driving a car is an action since the agent intends to
          do so, but sneezing is a mere behavior since it happens independent of
          the agent's intention. The dominant theory of the relation between the
          intention and the behavior is causalism: driving the car is an action
          because it is caused by the agent's intention to do so. On this view,
          actions are distinguished from other events by their causal history.
          Causalist theories include Donald Davidson's account, who defines
          actions as bodily movements caused by intentions in the right way, and
          volitionalist theories, according to which volitions or tryings form a
          core aspect of actions. Non-causalist theories, on the other hand,
          often see intentions not as the action's cause but as a constituent of
          it.

          ontologies. Fundamental ontologies do not claim to be accessible to
          any empirical proof in itself, but to be a structural design pattern,
          out of which empirical phenomena can be explained and put together
          consistently. Throughout Western history, the dominating fundamental
          ontology is the so-called substance theory. However, fundamental
          process ontologies are becoming more important in recent times,
          because the progress in the discovery of the foundations of physics
          spurred the development of a basic concept able to integrate such
          boundary notions as "energy," "object", and those of the physical
          dimensions of space and time.

          In control engineering, a state-space representation is a mathematical
          model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state
          variables related by first-order differential equations or difference
          equations. State variables are variables whose values evolve over time
          in a way that depends on the values they have at any given time and on
          the externally imposed values of input variables. Output variables'
          values depend on the values of the state variables.

          In science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a system which
          can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or transfer
          characteristics), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its
          implementation is "opaque" (black). The term can be used to refer to
          many inner workings, such as the ones of a transistor, an engine, an
          algorithm, the human brain, or an institution or government.

          In semantics, mathematical logic and related disciplines, the
          principle of compositionality is the principle that the meaning of a
          complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent
          expressions and the rules used to combine them. This principle is also
          called Frege's principle, because Gottlob Frege is widely credited for
          the first modern formulation of it. The principle was never explicitly
          stated by Frege, and it was arguably already assumed by George Boole
          decades before Frege's work.
