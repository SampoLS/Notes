          An address is a collection of information, presented in a mostly fixed
          format, used to give the location of a building, apartment, or other
          structure or a plot of land, generally using political boundaries and
          street names as references, along with other identifiers such as house
          or apartment numbers and organization name. Some addresses also
          contain special codes, such as a postal code, to make identification
          easier and aid in the routing of mail.

          A pattern is a regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in
          abstract ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a
          predictable manner. A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of
          geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper design.

          Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for
          abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional
          knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and
          problem-solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to
          perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be
          applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.
