          more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept

          distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how

          information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they

          propositions, and declarative sentences.

          Motivation is the reason for which humans and other animals initiate,

          are commonly understood as forces acting within the agent that create
          a disposition to engage in goal-directed behavior. It is often held
          that different mental states compete with each other and that only the
          strongest state determines behavior. This means that we can be
          motivated to do something without actually doing it. The paradigmatic
          mental state providing motivation is desire. But various other states,
          such as beliefs about what one ought to do or intentions, may also
          provide motivation. Motivation is derived from the word 'motive,'
          which denotes a person's needs, desires, wants, or urges. It is the
          process of motivating individuals to take action in order to achieve a
          goal. The psychological elements fueling people's behavior in the

          In the philosophy of mathematics, formalism is the view that holds
          that statements of mathematics and logic can be considered to be
          statements about the consequences of the manipulation of strings
          (alphanumeric sequences of symbols, usually as equations) using
          established manipulation rules. A central idea of formalism "is that
          mathematics is not a body of propositions representing an abstract
          sector of reality, but is much more akin to a game, bringing with it
          no more commitment to an ontology of objects or properties than ludo
          or chess." According to formalism, the truths expressed in logic and
          mathematics are not about numbers, sets, or triangles or any other
          coextensive subject matter — in fact, they aren't "about" anything at
          all. Rather, mathematical statements are syntactic forms whose shapes
          and locations have no meaning unless they are given an interpretation
          (or semantics). In contrast to mathematical realism, logicism, or
          intuitionism, formalism's contours are less defined due to broad

          components (other than its logical constants). Thus, logical truths

          Cognition refers to "the mental action or process of acquiring
          knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the
          senses". It encompasses all aspects of intellectual functions and
          processes such as: perception, attention, thought, intelligence, the
          formation of knowledge, memory and working memory, judgment and
          evaluation, reasoning and computation, problem solving and decision
          making, comprehension and production of language. Imagination is also
          a cognitive process, it is considered as such because it involves
          thinking about possibilities. Cognitive processes use existing
          knowledge and discover new knowledge.

          In the philosophy of logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or
          transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which
          takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or
          conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called modus ponens
          takes two premises, one in the form "If p then q" and another in the
          form "p", and returns the conclusion "q". The rule is valid with
          respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics
          of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises
          are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.

          In metaphysics, the distinction between abstract and concrete refers

          this difference has fundamental metaphysical significance. Examples of

          An abstract structure is a hypostatic abstraction that is defined by a
          set of laws, properties and relationships in a way that is logically
          if not always historically independent of the structure of contingent
          experiences, for example, those involving physical objects. Abstract
          structures are studied not only in logic and mathematics but in the
          fields that apply them, as computer science, and in the studies that
          reflect on them, such as philosophy (especially the philosophy of
          mathematics). Indeed, modern mathematics has been defined in a very
          general sense as the study of abstract structures (by the Bourbaki
          group: see discussion there, at algebraic structure and also

          Hypostatic abstraction in mathematical logic, also known as hypostasis

          In its most common sense, methodology is the study of research
          methods. However, the term can also refer to the methods themselves or
          to the philosophical discussion of associated background assumptions.
          A method is a structured procedure for bringing about a certain goal.
          In the context of research, this goal is usually to discover new
          knowledge or to verify pre-existing knowledge claims. This normally
          involves various steps, like choosing a sample, collecting data from
          this sample, and interpreting this data. The study of methods involves
          a detailed description and analysis of these processes. It includes
          evaluative aspects by comparing different methods to assess their
          advantages and disadvantages relative to different research goals and
          situations. This way, a methodology can help make the research process
          efficient and reliable by guiding researchers on which method to
          employ at each step. These descriptions and evaluations of methods
          often depend on philosophical background assumptions. The assumptions
          are about issues like how the studied phenomena are to be
          conceptualized, what constitutes evidence for or against them, and
          what the general goal of research is. When understood in the widest
          sense, methodology also includes the discussion of these more abstract
          issues.

          Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information

          discipline, the emphasis on ensuring accurate and honest collection

          quality evidence that allows analysis to lead to the formulation of
          convincing and credible answers to the questions that have been posed.
          Data collection and validation consists of four steps when it involves
