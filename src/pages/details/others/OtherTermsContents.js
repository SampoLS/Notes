          Interaction is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects
          have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is
          essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way
          causal effect. Closely related terms are interactivity and
          interconnectivity, of which the latter deals with the interactions of
          interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions
          can lead to surprising emergent phenomena. Interaction has different
          tailored meanings in various sciences.

          In logic and philosophy (especially metaphysics), a property is a
          characteristic of an object; a red object is said to have the property
          of redness. The property may be considered a form of object in its own
          right, able to possess other properties. A property, however, differs
          from individual objects in that it may be instantiated, and often in
          more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept
          of class by not having any concept of extensionality, and from the
          philosophical concept of class in that a property is considered to be
          distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how
          different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have
          some of the same properties is the basis of the problem of universals.

          Mastery learning (or, as it was initially called, "learning for

          strategy and educational philosophy, first formally proposed by
          Benjamin Bloom in 1968. Mastery learning maintains that students must
          achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in
          prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent
          information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they
          are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information
          and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner
          accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.
