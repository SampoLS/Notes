          more than one thing. It differs from the logical/mathematical concept
          of class by not having any concept of extensionality, and from the

          distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how

          information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they

          Relations are ways in which things, the relata, stand to each other.
          Relations are in many ways similar to properties in that both
          characterize the things they apply to. Properties are sometimes
          treated as a special case of relations involving only one relatum. In
          philosophy (especially metaphysics), theories of relations are
          typically introduced to account for repetitions of how several things
          stand to each other.

          street names as references, along with other identifiers such as house
          or apartment numbers and organization name. Some addresses also

          A pattern is a regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in

          geometric shapes and typically repeated like a wallpaper design.

          the rational, skeptical, and unbiased analysis or evaluation of
          factual evidence. Critical thinking is self-directed,
          self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It
          presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful
          command of their use. It entails effective communication and
          problem-solving abilities as well as a commitment to overcome native
          egocentrism and sociocentrism.
