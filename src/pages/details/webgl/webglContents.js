            Rendering is the process of generating an image from a model using
            computer programs. In graphics, a virtual scene is described using
            information like geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and
            shading, which is passed through a render program. The output of
            this render program will be a digital image.

          processing, a GPU consists of thousands of smaller cores that process
          parallel workloads efficiently. Therefore, the GPU accelerates the

          a complete frame data) intended for output to a display.

            After getting the WebGL context of the canvas object, you can start
            drawing graphical elements using WebGL API in JavaScript. Here are
            some fundamental terms you need to know before starting with WebGL.
          </p>
          <ol className="list">
            <li>
              <b>Vertices</b> - Generally, to draw objects such as a polygon, we
              mark the points on the plane and join them to form a desired
              polygon. A <b>vertex</b> is a point which defines the conjunction
              of the edges of a 3D object. It is represented by three floating
              point values each representing x, y, z axes respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Indices</b> - In WebGL, numerical values are used to identify
              the vertices. These numerical values are known as indices. These
              indices are used to draw meshes in WebGL.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Arrays</b> - Unlike OpenGL and JoGL, there are no predefined
              methods in WebGL to render the vertices directly. We have to store
              them manually using JavaScript arrays.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Buffers</b> - Buffers are the memory areas of WebGL that hold
              the data. There are various buffers namely, drawing buffer, frame
              buffer, <b>vetex buffer</b>, and <b>index buffer</b>. The vertex
              buffer and index buffer are used to describe and process the
              geometry of the model.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mesh</b> - To draw 2D or 3D objects, the WebGL API provides two
              methods namely, <b>drawArrays()</b> and <b>drawElements()</b>.
              These two methods accept a parameter called mode using which you
              can select the object you want to draw. The options provided by
              this field are restricted to points, lines, and triangles.
