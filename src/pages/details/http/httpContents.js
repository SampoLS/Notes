          Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps
          to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site
          Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for
          everything from data theft, to site defacement, to malware
          distribution. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which
          allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side
          code. This code is executed by the victims and lets the attackers
          bypass access controls and impersonate users. According to the Open
          Web Application Security Project, XSS was the seventh most common Web
          app vulnerability.

          An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data

          Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from
          the same browserâ€”keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers
          stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.

          The performance of web sites and applications can be significantly

          latency and network traffic and thus lessen the time needed to display
          resource representations. HTTP caching makes Web sites more
          responsive. For a web site, web caching is a major component in
          achieving high performance. However, the cache functionality must be
          configured properly, as not all resources stay identical forever: it's
          important to cache a resource only until it changes, not longer.

          A private cache is dedicated to a single user. You may have seen

          all documents the user downloads via HTTP. This cache is used to make
          visited documents available for back/forward navigation, saving,
          viewing-as-source, etc. without requiring an additional trip to the
          server. It also improves offline browsing of cached content.

          infrastructure to serve many users so that popular resources are
          reused a number of times, reducing network traffic and latency.
