          recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is{" "}

          instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.

          Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps
          to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site
          Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for
          everything from data theft, to site defacement, to malware
          distribution. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which
          allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side
          code. This code is executed by the victims and lets the attackers
          bypass access controls and impersonate users. According to the Open
          Web Application Security Project, XSS was the seventh most common Web
          app vulnerability.

          An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data
          that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the
          cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests.
          Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from
          the same browserâ€”keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers
          stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
