          In linguistics and philosophy, modality refers to the ways language
          can express various relationships to reality or truth. For instance, a
          modal expression may convey that something is likely, desirable, or
          permissible. Quintessential modal expressions include modal
          auxiliaries such as "could", "should", or "must"; modal adverbs such
          as "possibly" or "necessarily"; and modal adjectives such as
          "conceivable" or "probable". However, modal components have been
          identified in the meanings of countless natural language expressions,
          including counterfactuals, propositional attitudes, evidentials,
          habituals, and generics.

          In linguistics, grammatical mood is a grammatical feature of verbs,

          they are saying (for example, a statement of fact, of desire, of
          command, etc.). The term is also used more broadly to describe the

          In linguistics and grammar, a sentence is a linguistic expression,
          such as the English example "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
          dog." In traditional grammar, it is typically defined as a string of
          words that expresses a complete thought, or as a unit consisting of a
          subject and predicate. In non-functional linguistics it is typically
          defined as a maximal unit of syntactic structure such as a
          constituent. In functional linguistics, it is defined as a unit of
          written texts delimited by graphological features such as upper-case
          letters and markers such as periods, question marks, and exclamation
          marks. This notion contrasts with a curve, which is delimited by
          phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as
          pauses; and with a clause, which is a sequence of words that
          represents some process going on throughout time.

          In syntactic analysis, a constituent is a word or a group of words
          that function as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. The
          constituent structure of sentences is identified using tests for
          constituents. These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and the
          results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the
          sentence. Many constituents are phrases. A phrase is a sequence of one
          or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a head
          lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence
          is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the
          behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is
          associated mainly with phrase structure grammars, although dependency
          grammars also allow sentence structure to be broken down into
          constituent parts.
