The standard examples of grammatical functions from traditional grammar are subject, direct object, and indirect object. In recent times, the syntactic functions (more generally referred to as grammatical relations), typified by the traditional categories of subject and object, have assumed an important role in linguistic theorizing, within a variety of approaches ranging from generative grammar to functional and cognitive theories.[1] Many modern theories of grammar are likely to acknowledge numerous further types of grammatical relations (e.g. complement, specifier, predicative, etc.). The role of grammatical relations in theories of grammar is greatest in dependency grammars, which tend to posit dozens of distinct grammatical relations. Every head-dependent dependency bears a grammatical function.</p>

The totality of coordinator(s) and conjuncts forming an instance of coordination is called a coordinate structure. The unique properties of coordinate structures have motivated theoretical syntax to draw a broad distinction between coordination and subordination.

          In linguistics, a grapheme is the smallest functional unit of a
          writing system. The word grapheme, coined in analogy with phoneme, is
          derived from Ancient Greek γράφω (gráphō) 'write' and the suffix -eme
          by analogy with phoneme and other names of emic units. The study of
          graphemes is called graphemics. The concept of graphemes is abstract
          and similar to the notion in computing of a character. By comparison,
          a specific shape that represents any particular grapheme in a given
          typeface is called a glyph.

          In syntactic analysis, a constituent is a word or a group of words
          that function as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. The
          constituent structure of sentences is identified using tests for
          constituents. These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and the
          results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the
          sentence. Many constituents are phrases. A phrase is a sequence of one
          or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a head
          lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence
          is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the
          behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is
          associated mainly with phrase structure grammars, although dependency
          grammars also allow sentence structure to be broken down into
          constituent parts.

          In grammar, a part of speech or part-of-speech (abbreviated as POS or
          PoS, also known as word class or grammatical category) is a category
          of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) that have similar
          grammatical properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of
          speech generally display similar syntactic behavior (they play similar
          roles within the grammatical structure of sentences), sometimes
          similar morphological behavior in that they undergo inflection for
          similar properties and even similar semantic behavior.

          In linguistics, the grammar of a natural language is its set of
          structural constraints on speakers' or writers' composition of
          clauses, phrases, and words. The term can also refer to the study of
          such constraints, a field that includes domains such as phonology,
          morphology, and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics,
          and pragmatics. There are currently two different approaches to the
          study of grammar: traditional grammar and theoretical grammar.

          In linguistics, syntax (/ˈsɪntæks/) is the study of how words and

          Central concerns of syntax include word order, grammatical relations,
          hierarchical sentence structure (constituency), agreement, the nature
          of crosslinguistic variation, and the relationship between form and
          meaning (semantics). There are numerous approaches to syntax that

          A verb (from Latin verbum 'word') is a word (part of speech) that in
          syntax generally conveys an action (bring, read, walk, run, learn), an
          occurrence (happen, become), or a state of being (be, exist, stand).
          In the usual description of English, the basic form, with or without
          the particle to, is the infinitive. In many languages, verbs are
          inflected (modified in form) to encode tense, aspect, mood, and voice.
          A verb may also agree with the person, gender or number of some of its
          arguments, such as its subject, or object. Verbs have tenses: present,
          to indicate that an action is being carried out; past, to indicate
          that an action has been done; future, to indicate that an action will
          be done.

          In linguistics, conjugation is the creation of derived forms of a verb
          from its principal parts by inflection (alteration of form according
          to rules of grammar). For instance, the verb break can be conjugated
          to form the words break, breaks, broke, broken and breaking. While
          English has a relatively simple conjugation, other languages such as
          French and Arabic are more complex, with each verb having dozens of
          conjugated forms. Some languages such as Georgian and Basque have
          highly complex conjugation systems with hundreds of possible
          conjugations for every verb.
