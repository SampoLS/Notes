            The term asynchronous refers to two or more objects or events not
            existing or happening at the same time (or multiple related things
            happening without waiting for the previous one to complete).
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, a given program's code runs straight along, with only one
            thing happening at once. If a function relies on the result of
            another function, it has to wait for the other function to finish
            and return, and until that happens, the entire program is
            essentially stopped from the perspective of the user.

          Asynchronous techniques are very useful, particularly in web
          programming. When a web app runs in a browser and it executes an
          intensive chunk of code without returning control to the browser, the
          browser can appear to be frozen. This is called blocking; the browser
          is blocked from continuing to handle user input and perform other
          tasks until the web app returns control of the processor.

          A thread is basically a single process that a program can use to

          --&gt; Task B --&gt; Task C. Each task will be run sequentially; a
          task has to complete before the next one can be started.

          <p>
            Async callbacks are functions that are specified as arguments when
            calling a function which will start executing code in the
            background. When the background code finishes running, it calls the
            callback function to let you know the work is done, or to let you
            know that something of interest has happened. Using callbacks is
            slightly old-fashioned now, but you'll still see them in use in a
            number of older-but-still-commonly-used APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Callbacks are versatile â€” not only do they allow you to control the
            order in which functions are run and what data is passed between
            them, they also allow you to pass data to different functions
            depending on circumstance.
